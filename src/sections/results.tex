\begin{itemize}
  
  \li{Maintainability} The derivation approach is familiar and reduces boilerplate. The library architecture and parameterized resolver types allow modular API definitions.

  \li{Reliability} The Haskell compiler guarantees type safety. The library fulfills all critical parts of the specifications. However, the interfaces and directives are not yet fully implemented. 

  \li{Efficiency} The library is lazy and only executes the resolvers necessary for the query.
