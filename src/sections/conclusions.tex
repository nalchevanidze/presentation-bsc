\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]\frametitle{Conclusions}

The presented approach successfully implements the requirements and provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item easy-to-use interface while ensuring type safety.
    \item We preferred intuitive design over extensibility.
    \item The library can be learned quickly by beginners.
    \item Importing schemas from SDL facilitates quick starts and migration from other languages.
    \item A type-safe client package allows developers to implement entire applications in one language or even query data for resolvers from other GraphQL servers.
    \item \expr{Apps} are members of the type class semigroup and can be composed.
\end{itemize}

Limitations

\begin{itemize}
    \item Haskell permits different naming of values and types than GraphQL. 
    \item sets and non-empty collections cannot be modeled in GraphQL because it provides only list types for collections. 
    \item mapping Haskell types requires support for input unions, which is not supported by GraphQL. 
    \item Haskell does not provide interfaces, so we do not yet have a satisfying way to support them. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Outlook}

\begin{block}{Support Interfaces}

    representation of interfaces with "type guards" on unions. 

\end{block}

% \begin{block}{Type-Level Curried Arguments}

% straightforward argument definitions for a small number of arguments than our current approach since the user does not have to define a new data type for each field. 

% \end{block}

\begin{block}{Custom Collections}

the problem of custom collections. Since GraphQL has only one type (List) for collections, we cannot represent collections with certain constraints. 

\end{block}

\begin{block}{Support Directives} 

directives are used to annotate different parts of a GraphQL document to indicate that they should be evaluated differently~\cite{gql-spec}. 
% Since the GraphQL specification does not specify a particular implementation strategy for directives, it is up to each server library to provide a suitable API~\cite{schema-directives}.

\end{block}

\begin{block}{Support Input Unions} 

GraphQL does not support input unions. While this function's value is essentially understood, its implementation is not cleared and has been debated by the GraphQL community for many years, leading to several proposals~\cite{gql-spec-input-unions}. 

\end{block}
