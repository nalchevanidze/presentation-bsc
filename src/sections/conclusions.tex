\frametitle{Conclusions}

In this work, we presented Morpheus GraphQL, an EDSL for building GraphQL APIs in Haskell. The presented approach provides an easy-to-use interface based on a datatype-generic programming technique and successfully implements the requirements. We chose intuitive design (like Aeson) over extensibility provided by the type-level encoding. 
This gives beginners the ability to quickly learn and implement GraphQL APIs in Haskell while preserving type safety.
The library automatically derives APis from data types, which guarantees type-safe resolver values. We also provide two Template Haskell tools, one of which guarantees schema validity at compile time. The second one imports schemas from GraphQL SDL to facilitate quick start and migration from other languages.
The data resolvers are regular monadic Haskell functions. These resolvers can be extended by arbitrary monads to solve specific problems.  The architecture is divided into small independent packages. Besides, one of the packages, the Morpheus GraphQL client, enables type-safe queries by rejecting invalid queries at compile-time and automatically generating the request and response types.
