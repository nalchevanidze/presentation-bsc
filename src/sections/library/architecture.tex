\begin{enumerate} 

  \footnotesize
  
  \li{morpheus-graphql-core} low level functionalities and common types, such as  parsing, pretty-printing, validation.

  \li{morpheus-graphql-client} enables type-safe client queries. It generates the query and response types on valid queries but throws a compilation error on the invalid query.

  \li{morpheus-graphql-app} creates and executes GraphQL applications (called \expr{Apps}) based on schema and query documents.
  
  \li{morpheus-graphql-subscriptions}  creates WebSockets servers based on \expr{Apps}. It is independent of the server package and accepts any \expr{App} derived from an arbitrary server.

  \li{morpheus-graphql} derives executable \expr{Apps} from native Haskell types by mapping them to GraphQL representations.
