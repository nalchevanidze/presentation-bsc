    \begin{block}{Current challenges}
        Modern web applications must be adaptable, available anytime, anywhere, and support multiple devices \cite{char-of-modern-web-app}. This poses complexity, performance, and reliability challenges for development.  
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Haskell} Haskell has proven to be safe and capable of managing the complexity. 
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{GraphQL} GraphQL enables clients to query only the data they need, while servers can address multiple devices.
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{block}{GraphQL Haskell libraries}
    Existing GraphQL Haskell libraries either do not provide sufficient type safety or straightforward mapping, making them cumbersome to use.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Objectives}
Our goal is to provide a library that requires minimal effort to use and provides a good developer experience while still guaranteeing reliability.
