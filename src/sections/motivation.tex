    \begin{block}{Current Challenges}
        Modern web applications continuously transfer large amounts of data between clients and the server. They must be adaptable and available at any time, anywhere in the world, and support multiple devices. This presenting complexity, performance, and reliability challenges in development. 
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Haskell and  GraphQL}
        Haskell has proven to be safe and capable of managing the complexity. GraphQL enables clients to query only the data they need to improve performance, while servers can address multiple devices. Their combination can be useful to solve other problems.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{block}{GraphQL Haskell libraries}
    Existing GraphQL Haskell libraries either do not provide sufficient type safety or straightforward mapping, making them cumbersome to use.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Objectives}
Our goal is to provide a library that requires minimal effort to use and provides a good developer experience while still guaranteeing reliability.
