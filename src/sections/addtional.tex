\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mapping Rules}

% The underlying entity of every GraphQL schema is a type. Thereby there are six types of named type definitions and two wrapping types~\cite{gql-spec}. 
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}

  \li{Positional Constructors} GraphQL fields must always have names~\cite{gql-spec}. 
  That why we assume that a constructor without field selectors is enumerated like an array.
  
  \importHS{positional-cons}{Positional Constructors}

  \li{Unit Type} The unit type indicates the absence of a specific value and serves as a placeholder when no other value exists or is needed~\cite{fsharp-unit}. GraphQL does not provide it~\cite{gql-spec}.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Architecture Overview}
  \begin{enumerate} 
  
    \footnotesize

    \li{morpheus-graphql-core} low level functionalities and common types, such as  parsing, pretty-printing, validation.
  
    \li{morpheus-graphql-client} enables type-safe client queries. It generates the query and response types on valid queries but throws a compilation error on the invalid query.
  
    \li{morpheus-graphql-app} creates and executes GraphQL applications (called \expr{Apps}) based on schema and query documents.
    
    \li{morpheus-graphql-subscriptions}  creates WebSockets servers based on \expr{Apps}. It is independent of the server package and accepts any \expr{App} derived from an arbitrary server.
  
    \li{morpheus-graphql} derives executable \expr{Apps} from native Haskell types by mapping them to GraphQL representations. 
  
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Datatype-Generic Programming}
    
  Datatype-generic programming enables writing single functions that address various cases and types.~\cite{derivable-type-classes}. 
  It increases program reliability, reduces code duplication, while guaranteeing safety~\cite{datatype-generic-programming,optimizing-generics}.
  
  \importHS{generics}{Generic Deriving}
      
  The generic derivation represents all types and values by generic representation types. The user can convert any types to their generic representation, operate on them, and convert them back to their original types~\cite{optimizing-generics, ghc-generics}.
