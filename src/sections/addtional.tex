% The underlying entity of every GraphQL schema is a type. Thereby there are six types of named type definitions and two wrapping types~\cite{gql-spec}. 
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}

  \li{Positional Constructors} GraphQL fields must always have names~\cite{gql-spec}. 
  That why we assume that a constructor without field selectors is enumerated like an array.

  \li{Unit Type} The unit type indicates the absence of a specific value and serves as a placeholder when no other value exists or is needed~\cite{fsharp-unit}. GraphQL does not provide it~\cite{gql-spec}.
