\subsection{Haskell}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Haskell}

Haskell is a non-strict, purely functional language with static typing and algebraic data types. Many developers think that Haskell programs look nice~\cite{history-of-haskell}.

\begin{block}{Haskell is lazy}
    % Laziness is a primary concern in Haskell's design. 
    Haskell is a non-strict semantic language; lazy evaluation is just a technique to implement it~\cite{history-of-haskell}.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Haskell is pure}
The lazy evaluation requires a pure design since a function call can no longer guarantee the reliable execution of the side-effects. Haskell abstracts side effects with monads, which also allows the compiler to determine impure and pure operations~\cite{history-of-haskell}.
\end{block}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Algebraic Data Types and Records}

An algebraic data type is the sum of one or more alternatives, where each alternative is a product of zero or more fields~\cite{history-of-haskell}.

The record system provides syntactic sugar for what might otherwise be written using ordinary algebraic data type declarations~\cite{lw-ext-records}.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Record Values}

Records simplify programming with data structures since the individual components are accessed by name, and their order is not critical~\cite{lw-ext-records}.

\importHSFragment{records}{6}{10}{Haskell Record Values}

Algebraic data types and records and are not extensible by adding or removing data constructors or fields~\cite{hlist,lw-ext-records,trees-that-grow}.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Datatype-Generic Programming}
    
Datatype-generic programming enables writing single functions that address various cases and types.~\cite{derivable-type-classes}. 
It reduces code duplication, while guaranteeing safety~\cite{datatype-generic-programming,optimizing-generics}.
