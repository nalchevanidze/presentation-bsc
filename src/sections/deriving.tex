GraphQL models the schema as a graph, where nodes are types and fields are edges. The graph starts with a root node that branches to API-specific types~\cite{migrating-to-gql}. 

We use deep-first search and derive all schema types from the root node. We also use cycle checking to avoid looping on cycles.
